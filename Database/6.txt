Goodbye to my enemies, to my enemies

They try to beat me but I won't surrender

 Fear won't be the death of me, da da death of me

My pain is a memory, a memory

Pouring over like the stormy weather

This ain't a tragedy, a tra tra tragedy
                             Bm
I'm not going six feet in the ground
Em
It's not a fever dream it's reality

Cut me open and my hearts still beating
