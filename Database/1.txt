Verse 1:
Em                          C    Am
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Am                                      Em
D'you ever get that fear that you can't shift
Em
The type that sticks around like summet in your teeth?
Em        C          Am
Have some aces up your sleeve?
Am                              Em
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
Em
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
Em       C             Am
How many secrets can you keep?
Am                                       Em
'Cause there's this tune I've found that makes me think of you
Em
somehow
Em
And I play it on repeat
C     Am
Until I fall asleep
Am                    B
Spillin' drinks on my settee

Pre-chorus:
C
Do I wanna know?
Am
If this feelin' flows both ways?
	   Em
Sad to see you go
Em
Sorta hopin' that you'd stay
		C
Darlin' we both know
Am
That the nights were mainly made for sayin' things
Am
that you can't say
Em
tomorrow day

Chorus:
				 Em
Crawlin' back to you
Em              C
Ever thought of callin'
Am
When, you've 'ad a few
				Em
'Cause I always do
Em
Maybe I'm too
Em          C          Am
Busy bein' yours, to fall for, somebody new
				   Em
Now I've thought it through,
Em
Crawlin' back to you.

Verse:
C (1 strum)       Am  (1 strum)
So 'ave you got the guts?
					   Am (1)        Em (1)
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
	   Em (1)     Em (1)
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
C (1)         Am (1)
Simmer down and pucker up
							Em (1)
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of
Tryin'
C       Am                              Em           (stop)
To kiss you, but I dunno if you, feel the same as I do
Em             C   Am
We could be together,
Am            B
If you wanted to.

Pre-chorus:
C
Do I wanna know?
Am
If this feelin' flows both ways?
	   Em
Sad to see you go
Em
Sorta hopin' that you'd stay
		C
Darlin' we both know
Am
That the nights were mainly made for sayin' things
Am
that you can't say
Em
tomorrow day

Chorus:
				 Em
Crawlin' back to you
Em              C
Ever thought of callin'
Am
When, you've 'ad a few
				Em
'Cause I always do
Em
Maybe I'm too
Em          C          Am
Busy bein' yours, to fall for, somebody new
				   Em
Now I've thought it through,
Em
Crawlin' back to you.

C                                         Am
Do I wanna know, if this feelin' flows both ways?
Am     Em
Sad to see you go, was sorta hopin' that you'd stay

C                            Am                                 Em
Darlin' we both know, that the nights were mainly made for sayin'
Em
things that
Em
you can't say tomorrow day

Outro verse:
C (1) (stop)                  Am
Do I wanna know? Too busy bein' yours to fall
Am     Em
Sad to see you go,
Em              C
Ever thought of callin' darlin'
Am                              C              Am             Em
Do I wanna know? Do you want me crawlin' back to you? (End on Em)
