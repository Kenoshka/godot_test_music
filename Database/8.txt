Fm       Ab
I walk a lonely road,
    Eb            Bb          Fm
The only one that I have ever known.
           Ab
Don't know where it goes,
Eb               Bb             Fm
But it's home to me and I walk alone.

Instrumental: Fm Ab | Eb Bb

Fm       Ab
I walk this empty street
    Eb            Bb         Fm
On the boulevard of broken dreams,
           Ab
Where the city sleeps
    Eb           Bb              Fm Ab
And I'm the only one and I walk alone.

 Eb        Bb
   I walk alone,
           Fm    Ab
   I walk alone.

 Eb        Bb
   I walk alone,

Chorus:
  Db    Ab           Eb            Fm
     My shadow's the only one that walks beside me.
  Db    Ab      Eb               Fm
     My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.
  Db     Ab      Eb               Fm
     Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me.
  Db      Ab     C
     'Til then I walk alone.

 Fm     Ab     Eb      Bb    Fm
   Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah,
        Ab     Eb      Bb
   Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah.

Fm       Ab
I'm walking down the line
    Eb            Bb          Fm
That divides me somewhere in my mind.
           Ab
On the border line
Eb               Bb            Fm
Of the edge and where I walk alone.

Fm       Ab
Read between the lines
    Eb            Bb          Fm
Of what's fucked up and everything's alright.
           Ab
Check my vital signs
Eb               Bb             Fm  Ab
And know I'm still alive and I walk alone.

 Eb        Bb
   I walk alone,
           Fm    Ab
   I walk alone.

 Eb        Bb
   I walk alone,
