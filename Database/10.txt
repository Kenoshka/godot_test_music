[Куплет 1]:
C#m
Memories broken
    E
The truth goes unspoken
     F#                G#
I’ve even forgotten my name
  C#m
I don’t know the season
   E
Or what is the reason
    F#                        C#m
I’m standing here holding my blade

[Бридж]:
  C#m
A desolate place
   E
Without any trace
     F#                    C#m
It’s only the cold wind I feel

[Куплет 2]:
     C#m
It’s me that I spite
     E
As I stand up and fight
N.C.
The only thing I know for real

[Припев]:
              C#m   E
There will be blood-shed
    F#                E
The man in the mirror nods his head
         C#m  E
The only one left
     F#              G#
Will ride upon the dragon’s back

             C#m                  E                 F#
Because the mountains don’t give back what they take
N.C.
Oh, no
              C#m   E
There will be blood-shed
         F#              E         C#m
It’s the only thing I’ve ever known

[Соло]:
C#m  E  F#  D
C#m  E  A   G#

[Концовка]:
C#m         E
Losing my identity
          F#             G#
Wondering have I gone insane
   C#m                E
To find the truth in front of me
        F#                 G#
I must climb this mountain range
        A
Looking downward from this deadly height
           B                     F#    G#    C#m
And never realizing why I fight
