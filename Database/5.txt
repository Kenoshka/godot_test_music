Em
On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
D
You can listen to the engines moanin'
D
Out as one old song
Am
You can think about the woman or the girl
Am
You knew the night before

Em

Em
But your thoughts will soon be wandering
Em
The way they always Do
D
When you're ridin' sixteen hours
D
And there's nothin' much to Do
Am
And you don't feel much like riding
Am
You just wish the trip was through

Em

D              Em
Here I am, on the road again
D              Em
There I am, up on the stage
D              Am
There I go, playin' star again
C           D         Em
There I go, turn the page

Em
So you walk into this restaurant
Em
Strung out from the road
D
And you feel the eyes upon you
D
As you're shaking off the cold
Am
You pretend it doesn't bother you
Am
But you just want to explode

Em

Em
Yeah most times you can't hear 'em talk
Em
But other times you can
D
All the same old clich√©s:
D
'Is it woman? Is it man?'
Am
And you always seem outnumbered
Am
You don't dare make a stand
Em
Make your stand

D              Em
Here I am, on the road again
D              Em
There I am, up on the stage
D             Am
Here I go, playin' star again
C           D          Em
There I go, turn the page

Em
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Dm
Every ounce of energy you try and give away
A
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play

Em

Em
Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed
D
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
Am
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Am
Rememberin' what she said
Em
What she said

Yeah

D              Em
Here I am, on the road again
D              Em
There I am, up on the stage
D             Am
Here I go, playin' star again
C           D           Em
There I go, turn the page
C           D           Em
And there I go, turn that page
C      D     Em
There I go, yeah
C      D     Em
Here I go, yeah
C      D     Em
Here I go, yeah
C      D     Em
Here I go, yeah
C      D     Em
There I go, there I Go
C      D     Em
(And I'm gone)
