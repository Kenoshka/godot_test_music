[Verse 1]
Em
I'm checking my vital signs
Drawing my battle lines
Going to war again
C
Feeling the rhythm inside of my chest
All I need is just a pen
    A
I know I was born for this
    D
I know I was born for this

[Verse 2]
Em
Don't care for the critics
My words are like physics
A force that they can't stop
C
They just don't get it, I think they forget
I'm not done 'til I'm on top
     A
I know I was born for this
     D
I know I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
C
I believe, I believe
We can write our story
D
I believe, I believe
We can be an army

[Chorus]
Em
 We are the warriors,   who learned to love the pain
C
We come from different places, but have the same name
G
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
D
Born for this, we were born for this
Em
 We are the broken ones,   who chose to spark a flame
C
Watch as our fire rages, our hearts are never tame
G
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
D
Born for this, we were born for this

[Verse 3]
Em
I've struggled for years and
Through all of the tears
I've faced the doubts I hide
C
I never gave into my fears deep within
'Cause I heard my voice inside
  A
I know I was born for this
  D
I know I was born for this

[Verse 4]
Em
I will never lose my voice
     C
If I cut out all the noise
  A
I know, I was born for this
  D
I know, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
C
I believe, I believe
We can write our story
D
I believe, I believe
We can be an army

[Chorus]
Em
 We are the warriors,   who learned to love the pain
C
We come from different places, but have the same name
G
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
D
Born for this, we were born for this
Em
 We are the broken ones,   who chose to spark a flame
C
Watch as our fire rages, our hearts are never tame
G
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
D
Born for this, we were born for this

Em

[Verse 5]
Em
These words that I write are for someone like me
To know you're not alone
C
The moves that you make ya they come with mistakes
Don't ever lose your hope
     A
Just know, you were born for this
     D
Just know, you were born for this

[Chorus]
Em
 We are the warriors,   who learned to love the pain
C
We come from different places, but have the same name
G
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
D
Born for this, we were born for this
Em
 We are the broken ones,   who chose to spark a flame
C
Watch as our fire rages, our hearts are never tame
G
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
'Cause we were, 'cause we were
D
Born for this, we were born for this
